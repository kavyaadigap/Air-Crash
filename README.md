The main intention of the analysis is to analyse the main reason as to why an aircraft crash, by classifying the reason of why the accident has happened using Naive Bayes algorithm and then analysing the data to find some patterns, trends in the crashes. There are multiple reasons like aircraft model problem, weather, pilot error etc., has been analysed. This will help in adding some more restrictions, pre-flight checks, good pilot training, making some changes in the technology in the aircraft. The dataset used for analyses in from Kaggle which has all the accidents piled up from 1908 to 2009.
